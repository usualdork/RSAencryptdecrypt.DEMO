# RSAencryptdecrypt.DEMO
This Python project uses RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) encryption and decryption, a widely-used public-key cryptographic system. The code provides a simple implementation of key pair generation, encryption, and decryption using the RSA algorithm.

Key Features:
- Generate RSA key pairs with specified prime numbers (p and q).
- Encrypt a message using the public key.
- Decrypt the encrypted message using the private key.

Usage:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the Python script to see a demo of RSA encryption and decryption.
3. You can modify the prime numbers (p and q) to experiment with different key pairs and messages.

Note: This is a basic implementation for educational purposes and is not suitable for production use.
